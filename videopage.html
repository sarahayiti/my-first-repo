            <h2>Warm-up</h2>
            <p>Before diving into any workout, a proper warm-up is key. It helps increase your heart rate, loosen up tight muscles, and prepare your body for movement. A few minutes of light stretching, jogging in place, or dynamic moves like arm circles and leg swings can prevent injuries and get you in the right mindset to crush your workout.</p>

            <h2>Abs workout</h2>
            <p>Core exercises are more than just building six-pack abs, they strengthen the muscles that support your spine and improve your posture. From crunches and planks to bicycle kicks and leg raises, these routines target your entire midsection. A strong core makes everyday activities easier and helps you perform better in any other workout you do.</p>
