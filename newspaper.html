        <p class="text">HOGWARTS, SCOTLAND â€“ A night of undead revelry ended in pure terror at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after the discovery of a menacing message and a severely injured victim. Gryffindor ghost Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington hosted his elaborate 500th Deathday party in the dungeons last night. However, the fun was cut short when a chilling, disembodied voice lured a group of students into an upstairs corridor.</p>
        <p class="text">The students found the ominous words "THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE." scrawled in what appeared to be blood on the stone wall. Dangling directly beneath the message was Mrs. Norris, the cat belonging to caretaker Argus Filch, found rigid and seemingly lifeless. The attack is being investigated, but fear is now gripping the castle as a dark legend about the school's secret founder appears to have come true. The safety of all non-pure-blood students is now gravely questioned.</p>
